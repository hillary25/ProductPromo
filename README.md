# Product Promo App - Sunnies
This project was built for an assignment for Fanshawe College. Individually, we were to design and build a simple one-page site for a product of our choosing. The site had to use NodeJS and Express, while integrating Heroku to see a live version of the site. My final build is a fictional website for a sunglasses company called Sunnies.
## Built With
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/ "Bootstrap") - Bootstrap Responsive Framework
* [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/ "Sass") - Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets Language
